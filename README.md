# MediaScan

1)The app should scan all the files in the device

2)get top 10 files based on the size

3)Most frequent file types

4)Share the results

P.s Must write a background service to do the task

wrote this app for Macy's interview.

They rejected me bcz they litterally wanted me to go through all the folders/files to Scan for the files.(which they didnt mention) 

Which is a time consuming unnecessary operation, while android already provides Media storage content provider which you can use 
to get the output instantaneously.
