# MediaScan

1)The app should scan all the files in the device

2)get top 10 files based on the size

3)Most frequent file types

4)Share the results

P.s Must write a background service to do the task

wrote this app for Macy's interview. Unfortunatly they wanted me to go through each file system to scan instead of using android's built in content provider.

A small communication gap
